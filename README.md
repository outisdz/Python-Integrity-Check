# Python-Integrity-Check
`integrity-check.py` is a Python script for verifying file integrity.   It generates a SHA-256 hash that includes both file contents and timestamp metadata, allowing you to detect tampering of both data and file attributes.   You can create and check hash files, or verify against a provided hash digest, all from a simple command-line interface.
